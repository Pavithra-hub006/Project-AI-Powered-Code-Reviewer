## 📌 Project Description

**AI-Powered Code Reviewer** is an intelligent software application that automatically reviews source code and provides **context-aware feedback, explanations, and improvement suggestions** using **Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Large Language Models (LLMs)**.

The system simulates a real-world automated code review assistant capable of analyzing programming logic, structure, readability, and best practices.
It is designed for **academic projects**, **Infosys certification submission**, and **local execution for experimentation with AI-driven software quality tools**.

## 🧠 Techniques Used

### 🔹 Natural Language Processing (NLP)

* Converts code structure into meaningful text representations
* Understands syntax, semantics, and intent of code
* Generates explanations and feedback in natural language

### 🔹 Prompt Engineering

* Carefully structured prompts for:

  * Code review
  * Error explanation
  * Improvement suggestions
* Ensures consistent and reliable AI responses
* Reduces ambiguity and irrelevant outputs

### 🔹 LLM-Based Text Generation

* Uses transformer-based language models
* Generates:

  * Code explanations
  * Review comments
  * Best-practice suggestions
* Produces developer-friendly feedback

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### 🔹 Programming Language

* **Python 3.x**

### 🔹 Libraries / Frameworks

## ⚙️ Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Pavithra-hub006/Project-AI-Powered-Code-Reviewer.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory**

   ```
   cd Project-AI-Powered-Code-Reviewer
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment (recommended)**

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment**

   * Windows:

     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   * Linux / macOS:

     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install required dependencies**

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## ▶️ How to Run the Project Locally

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed

2. Configure the LLM API key (if required)

   ```
   export LLM_API_KEY=your_api_key
   ```

   or set it directly inside the configuration file

3. Run the application

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

4. Provide a source code file as input and receive AI-generated review output

---

## 🧪 Running Tests

To execute automated tests and generate reports:

```
pytest
```

For JSON test reports:

```
pytest --json-report --json-report-file=storage/reports/pytest_results.json
```
